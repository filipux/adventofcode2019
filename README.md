| 1 | Here we go again | [Day 1](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a01.nim) |
| 2 | CPU again :) based it on last year's code so it didn't take many minutes to solve | [Day 2](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a02.nim) |
| 3 | Meh, messy code. Sets are pretty cool I guess. | [Day 3](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a03.nim) |
| 4 | There is a clever solution hiding somewhere but I don't have the motivation to find it. | [Day 4](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a04.nim) |
| 5 | CPU is progressing nicely. Still quite clean code. Lots of fun! | [Day 5](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a05.nim) |
| 6 | Happy with my code. Realized I could use sets to solve part 2 using the fancy symmetric difference operator '-+-' ðŸ¥³  | [Day 6](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a06.nim) |
| 7 | Struggled a bit with this one. Had to refactor the code to allow multiple cpus. | [Day 7](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a07.nim) |
| 8 | Got stuck for 15 minutes because I tried to do a reversed double-dot for loop (`for x in 10..0:`). It does no loops with no errors but I think it should work. | [Day 8](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a08.nim) |
