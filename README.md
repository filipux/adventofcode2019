| 1 | Here we go again | [Day 1](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a01.nim) |
| 2 | CPU again :) based it on last year's code so it didn't take many minutes to solve | [Day 2](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a02.nim) |
| 3 | Meh, messy code. Sets are pretty cool I guess. | [Day 3](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a03.nim) |
| 4 | There is a clever solution hiding somewhere but I don't have the motivation to find it. | [Day 4](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a04.nim) |
| 5 | CPU is progressing nicely. Still quite clean code. Lots of fun! | [Day 5](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a05.nim) |
| 6 | Happy with my code. Realized I could use sets to solve part 2 using the fancy symmetric difference operator '-+-' ðŸ¥³  | [Day 6](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a06.nim) |
| 7 | Struggled a bit with this one. Had to refactor the code to allow multiple cpus. | [Day 7](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a07.nim) |
| 8 | Got stuck for 15 minutes because I tried to do a reversed double-dot for loop (`for x in 10..0:`). This really should be allowed in Nim. | [Day 8](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a08.nim) |
| 9 | IntCode computer again. Struggled with Nim, got some errors when trying to nest templates to much, but it turned out nice in the end. | [Day 9](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a09.nim) |
| 10 | Figured out to use polar coordinates. Crappy code.  | [Day 10](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a10.nim) |
| 11 | IntCode again. Lot's of fun. | [Day 11](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a11.nim) |
| 12 | N-body simulation. Code works but I didn't find any time to make it pretty. | [Day 12](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a12.nim) |
| 13 | It's a breakout game! Cool stuff :D | [Day 13](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a13.nim) |
| 14 | Gahhh, this one took alot of time to solve. Strange equation solving and graphs. Got it right in the end. | [Day 14](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a14.nim) |
| 15 | IntCode + Pathfinding| [Day 15](https://github.com/filipux/adventofcode2019/blob/master/a15.nim) |
